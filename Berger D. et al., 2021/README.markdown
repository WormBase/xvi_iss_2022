Control and elimination of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis relies on mass administration of praziquantel. Whilst these programmes reduce infection prevalence and intensity, their impact on parasite transmission and evolution is poorly understood. Here we examine the genomic impact of repeated mass drug administration on Schistosoma mansoni populations with documented reduced praziquantel efficacy. We sequenced whole-genomes of 198 S. mansoni larvae from 34 Ugandan children from regions with contrasting praziquantel exposure. Parasites infecting children from Lake Victoria, a transmission hotspot, form a diverse panmictic population. A single round of treatment did not reduce this diversity with no apparent population contraction caused by long-term praziquantel use. We find evidence of positive selection acting on members of gene families previously implicated in praziquantel action, but detect no high frequency functionally impactful variants. As efforts to eliminate schistosomiasis intensify, our study provides a foundation for genomic surveillance of this major human parasite.

# Using WormBase ParaSite

In this paper, the researchers examine the genomic impact of repeated mass drug administration on Schistosoma mansoni populations with documented reduced praziquantel efficacy.

They collected samples from regions in Uganda with different exposure to praziquantel and performed whole genome sequencing to explore how schistosome populations change in response to repeated MDA as well as to monitor for the potential emergence and spread of praziquantel resistance.

###Â Annotate genomic regions
Following population genomic analyses, researchers identified a list of genomic regions as being under strong selection in Mayuge where we expect selection for survival following praziquantel treatment to be strongest.

These genomic regions are:

We can use BioMart to find which genes are in these regions. Because this paper is using an older S. mansoni assembly, we will use the [archived WormBase ParaSite 16 release](https://release-16.parasite.wormbase.org/) which has this assembly.

1. Go to [WormBase ParaSite archive 16](https://release-16.parasite.wormbase.org/)
2. Click BioMart at the top menu.
3. Select the "Schistosoma mansoni PRJEA36577" species in the SPECIES tab.
4. Paste the above genomic coordinates into the dialog box under the REGION tab.

They can use biomart/VEP or jbrowse to see what genes etc are included in these regions.
